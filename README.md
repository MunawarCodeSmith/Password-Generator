Created a user-friendly web-based tool for generating secure passwords using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed a simple yet intuitive interface
with HTML for structuring the layout and CSS for styling. Implemented password generation functionality in JavaScript, allowing users to generate
passwords of varying lengths with options for including special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters. Overcame challenges in
ensuring password security and randomness by researching and implementing best practices for password generation algorithms. This project
enhanced my proficiency in web development technologies and deepened my understanding of JavaScript programming principles. Independently
conceived and developed the Password Generator, demonstrating initiative and problem-solving skills in creating a valuable utility for users."
